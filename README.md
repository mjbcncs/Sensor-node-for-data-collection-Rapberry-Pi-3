# Sensor-node-for-data-collection-Raspberry-Pi-3
Part of my research project
To collect built environment data, I customized this sensor node with Raspberry Pi and raw sensors. The first one is used to configure the pi with the sensors,
the second one is used for upload data files that are saved on the Micro SD card to my dropbox account.
